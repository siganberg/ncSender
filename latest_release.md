## What's Changed

### ✨ New Features
- Tool-based color coding: Each tool (T1-T16) now displays with its own distinct color for both rapid and cutting moves
- Individual tool visibility controls: Toggle each tool on/off independently to focus on specific operations
- Predefined color palette: 16 tools with consistent, recognizable colors (T1 = blue, T2 = orange, etc.)

### 🔧 Improvements
- Enhanced G-code visualization with larger, more readable legend (16px text) repositioned to the left side
- Improved view controls with larger button text (16px) for Top/Side/3D and Clear buttons
- CAD-style camera rotation with natural quaternion-based trackball controls
- Increased tool button borders for better visual distinction in G-code programs
